# skeleton
A Pelican theme styled with Skeleton

## Impressum

If you need to include an impressum on your page, you can set
``DISPLAY_IMPRESSUM`` to ``True``. The page itself has to be a page in the
Pelican sense and has to be named ``impressum.md``. Take care to also set
``status: hidden`` in order to hide it from the rest of the blog.

## SkeletonImages plugin

The plugin orientation in the SkeletonImages package can be used to add the
classes `landscape, square, portrait, portrait32, portrait43, portrait54` to
image tags in order to make their responsive scaling work as defined in the
`mystyle.css`.

## Colophon
This theme is based on the `simple` theme of
[Pelican](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican). The css styling was performed
using [Skeleon](https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton).
